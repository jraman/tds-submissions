    "# Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n",
    "A Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures changes in the price level of a weighted average market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by households. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index)\n",
    "The CPI is a statistical estimate constructed using the prices of a sample of representative items whose prices are collected periodically. Sub-indices and sub-sub-indices are computed for different categories and sub-categories of goods and services.  The overall index is computed as a weighted average of sub-indices for different components of consumer expenditure, such as food, housing, shoes, clothing, each of which is in turn a weighted average of sub-sub-indices.  The annual percentage change in a CPI is used as a measure of inflation."

    "Among the cities, in the mid-70s, NY has the highest overall CPI\n",
    "followed by Boston and Philly.  On the lower end are Dallas, Houston,\n",
    "Pittsburgh, and San Francisco.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mid-90s, NY continues to top the charts and Boston and Philly\n",
    "continue to stay at the top.  San Francisco and Chicago, which had low\n",
    "CPI in the mid-70s, now have higher CPI comparitively.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this says is that NY, Boston and Philly have always been\n",
    "expensive cities to live in, whereas SF and Chicago started off as\n",
    "affodable cities, but became expensive in the mid-90s.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Food at home\n",
    "This category seems to have the most data, surprisingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mid-70s, Boston is by far the most expensive, followed by\n",
    "Philly, Baltimore and Chicago.  DC, Dallas, LA and SF start out as the\n",
    "least expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mid-90s, Dallas and Pittsburgh are the least expensive,\n",
    "followed by Detroit and St. Louis--all of these cities have a CPI\n",
    "under 144.  Houston, Boston and DC have moderate CPI.  The rest of the\n",
    "pack have CPIs at or above 155.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Food away from home\n",
    "Detroit, DC and Boston are the most expensive in the mid-70s.  Houston\n",
    "is by far the least expensive, followed by Dallas, Philly and SF.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mid-90s, Miami is the most expensive, although data for it is\n",
    "sparse in the mid-70s, followed by NY and Boston.  Houston remains the\n",
    "least expensive, followed by Philly.  Dallas has moved to the top tier\n",
    "whereas SF is moderate.\n",

    "Dallas, Houston and Pittsburgh are the least expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mid-90s, LA is the most expensive in this category, followed by\n",

    "Dallas has moved from being among the least expensive in the mid-70s\n",
    "to being the most expensive in the mid-90s.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1991 Federal tax change\n",
    "There is a **distinctive jump** (increase) in the CPI between the end of\n",
    "1990 and the beginning of 1991!  The reason for this is probably the\n",
    "change in the federal tax on alcohol that took effect on January 1,\n",
    "1991 [see here](https://www.nber.org/digest/may12/w17709.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Shelter\n",
    "The overall rate of increase in shelter is higher than that of\n",

    "the overall CPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mid-70s, Philly is the most expensive followed by NY.  Chicago\n",

    "expensive.  Chicago, which was at the bottom of the pack in the\n",
    "mid-70s, has now moved to the third position.  The disparity between\n",
    "the least and the most expensive has held ground and is now 41%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the ratio of the highest to the lowest remaining constant and\n",

    "mid-70s.\n",

    "## 5. Fuel and other utilities\n",

    "\n",
    "### Seasonal changes\n",
    "**Seasonal changes** are evident in the graph--with prices rising in\n",

    "Price changes in this category underperform overall inflation.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In the mid-90s, DC is the most expensive, followed by Dallas, Miami\n",

    "## 7. Men's and boy's apparel\n",

    "compared to the other categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chicago is the most expensive in the mid-70s while Houston is the\n",
    "least expensive.  They have a differential of 43% between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mid-90s, Houston is now the most expensive and shows large\n",
    "variations in prices--in early to mid 1993, the CPI crosses 180, but\n",
    "falls back below 160 in mid 1995.  Philly and SF are the least\n",
    "expensive.  The differential between the most and least expensive is\n",

    "\n",
    "## 8. Women's and girl's apparel\n",
    "The prices in this cateogory have moved less compared to other\n",
    "categories and even less so compared to men's apparel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mid-70s, Philly and LA are the most expensive--in fact, more\n",

    "DC and St. Louis are the least expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mid-90s, SF and Philly are by far the least expensive--in fact,\n",
    "less expensive than in mid-1983.  Miami is the most expensive in this\n",
    "category.  There appears to be a larger variation in the more\n",
    "expensive cities.  Is this caused by the basket containing items that\n",
    "vary more, such as designer clothing?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Footwear\n",
    "In the mid-70s, Detroit and St. Louis are the most expensive, whereas\n",
    "Boston is the least expensive followed by Houston and DC.  The\n",
    "differential between them is around 55%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the mid-90s, Chicago is the most expensive, followed by Baltimore,\n",
    "Boston, Miami and NY.  St. Louis is the least expensive followed by\n",
    "Philly and LA.  The differential is around 73%.\n",
    "\n",
    "What part does designer footware and clothing play in the CPI of\n",
    "footwear and clothing?  Does that account for the higher variability\n",
    "in some cities?\n",

    "## 10. Private transportation\n",
    "A general **downward trend** from 1/1986 through 4/1986 can be observed.\n",

    "plot also includes utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1/1976, there isn't much variability between the cities varying\n",
    "from 49.1 in Pittsburgh to 58.6 in Boston--for a difference of 19.3%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 5/1995, the variability remains about the same--a difference of\n",
    "17.2% between 124.7 in SF and 146.2 in Philly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Public transportation\n",
    "Public transportation prices rise slowly from 1976 through 1979 and\n",
    "accelerate their rise in 1980.  The prices between the cities is\n",
    "bunched together while rising till 1988, when they start to diverge.\n",
    "The price of public transportation in LA rises faster and higher than\n",
    "in the other cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prices in 1/1976 hover between 39.7 in Pittsburgh to 58.0 in\n",

    "end.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1995, prices in LA have exceeded 200.  St. Louis has the lowest\n",

    "\n",
    "## 12. Medical care\n",
    "In 1976, medical care costs are highest in NY while Houston,\n",
    "Pittsburgh and LA have the lowest costs.  The range is from 45.5 to\n",
    "54.5 for a difference of almost 20%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1995, costs have skyrocketed to over 200 across all cities.  Costs\n",
    "in NY have more than quarupled to 226.  The price is highest in Boston\n",
    "at 265.1 and lowest in Miami at 201.7 for a difference of 31.4%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the skyrocketing healthcare costs in the US, it is not\n",
    "surprising that this category shows the biggest jump in prices between\n",
    "1976 and 1995.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. Personal care\n",
    "In 1976, prices vary from 52.5 in Houston to 71.5 in Detroit.  A\n",
    "difference of 30.7% can be seen in 10/1976 between the two cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1995, prices vary from 103.8 in Miami to 189 in Philly.  In 5/1995,\n",

    "## 14. Entertainment\n",

    "Boston are 19% higher than in Miami.\n",

Similar observations for other cities such as Baltimore (BA), Boston (BO), Detroit (DT), Houston (HS), Pittsburg (PI), San Francisco (SF), St. Louis (ST), and Washington D.C. (WA).  It's odd that there's more data for food-at-home than for city-wide CPI.  It makes one wonder if the city-wide column may be inadvertantly switched to the one-numbered column."
